PROGRAM EXECUTION:
-The name of the program source code file is “packet_analysis.py”. It is written in python.

-There are 6 xml(.xml) files, each of them corresponding to each of the 6 packet capture(.pcapng) files with the same names.
e.g: “ws_wireless.xml” file corresponds to the capture file “ws_wireless.pcapng”.
-These files are given as input to the packet log analyzer program “packet_analysis.py”.

**All the packet captures and the xml files are submitted using gmail, as the files were too large for git hub submission. The files were sent from the email pcsimhadri@uh.edu.

-Run the program by typing the “make” command. The execution takes few minutes to complete!

-This will generate 6 text(.txt) files. Each of them corresponding to each of the 6 packet captures(.pcapng) files. the text files have the same name as the packet captures(.pcapng) with an extension of “_op”.
e.g.:  “ws_wireless_op.txt” file corresponds to the capture file “ws_wireless.pcapng”.

-These text files contain the analysis report of each of the 6 packet captures(.pcapng). 

-HW questions are answered in the analysis.pdf file.
